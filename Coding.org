* Coding Conventions

In order to keep code clean, readable and uniform, some coding
conventions are needed. Most of them are covered by using
[[https://prettier.io/][Prettier]], use of which is mandatory.

*General:*
- Do *not* try to be fancy or clever: Keep it simple and easy to read
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first
  place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you
  are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.
  -- Brian Kernighan 
  #+END_QUOTE
- Code duplication should be avoided. If you deem it necessary in
  certain cases, leave a statement to the reviewer and future readers,
  why you deem it necessary.

*Variables:*
- Use =camelCase= for naming variables
- Constants are =SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE=
- In all other variables, do not use =hyp-hens= or =under_scores=
- Variable names start with a letter
- Names are clear and descriptive (exceptions for iterators can be
  made, if not overused)
- Always declare variables
- Reduce global variables as far as possible

*Spaces and blank lines:*
- Blank lines improve readability by setting off sections of code that
  are logically related.

*If-statements:*
- Always use braces, even for one line bodies

#+BEGIN_SRC js
if (true) {
  console.log("I have braces :)");
}
#+END_SRC

** Javascript

*Declarations:*
- Use =const=, if not possible use =let=. Do *not* use =var=.

*Functions:*
- Use functional definitions
  #+BEGIN_SRC js
  const myConstantFunc = (_) => 7
  const mySlightlyMoreComplexFunc = (a, b) => {
    return a + b;
  };
  #+END_SRC
- Parameters follow the same rules as variables
- If a parameter is not used you can use =_= to indicate this
