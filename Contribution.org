* Contributing Conventions

- Discuss changes on the GitHub Issue tracker
- Make your PRs against the =master= branch
- Do clean changesets:
  - Focus on some topic, resist changing anything else
  - Do not do style changes mixed with functional changes
  - Try to avoid refactorings mixed with functional changes
  - If you need to fix something after commit/push
    - If there are ongoing reviews: talk to the reviewers and
      coordinate a fix
    - If there are no ongoing reviews or you did not push the bad
      commit yet: amend the commit to include your fix or merge the
      fixup commit before pushing
  - Have a nice, clear, typo-free commit comment
  - If you fixed an issue, refer to it in your commit comment
  - Follow the style guide (see below)
- If you write new code, please add tests and docs for it
- Run tests
  - Before every Push/PR
  - Make sure, branch coverage is 100% (except for extreme rare cases)
  - Fix upcoming issues
- Make a pull request on GitHub
- Wait for review by other developers
